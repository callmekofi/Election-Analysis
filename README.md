# 2012 US Election-Analysis
This Data Analysis Project looks at data from the 2012 election in the USA. The data for the polls will be obtained from HuffPost Pollster.

In this project we will analyze two datasets. The first data set will be the results of political polls. We will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?

2.) Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?

3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll?

4.) Can we account for the undecided voters?

5.) How did voter sentiment change over time?

6.) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
